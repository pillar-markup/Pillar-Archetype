# Pillar-Archetype

This project is obsolete for now (Pillar 8. Febr 2020). 

Archetypes are templates for [Pillar](https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar) projects.

Each subdirectory becomes available as a project skeleton to the `pillar archetype` command, e.g. `pillar archetype book` should give you a fresh template of a book project, ready to build and to write.

To add a new archetype, create a new folder and put your files there. 
When you modify any of the files of the available archetype, run the ci https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/job/Pillar-Archetypes/.
It will zip the files and the command can use them.
